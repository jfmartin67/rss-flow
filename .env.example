# Vercel KV (Redis) credentials
# Get these from your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores
# Vercel automatically provides ALL of these when you connect a KV database to your project

# Direct Redis connection (traditional Redis protocol)
KV_URL=your_kv_url_here

# REST API over HTTP (preferred for serverless, used by @vercel/kv)
KV_REST_API_URL=your_kv_rest_api_url_here
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_kv_rest_api_token_here              # Full access (read + write)
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=your_kv_read_only_token_here   # Read-only access (security)

# Note: The @vercel/kv SDK automatically uses REST API in serverless environments
# All variables above are provided by Vercel - just copy them all from the dashboard

# KV Key Prefix (namespace) - Important when sharing KV instance with other projects
# This prevents key collisions between different applications
# Default: "rss-flow" (optional, can be customized)
KV_PREFIX=rss-flow
